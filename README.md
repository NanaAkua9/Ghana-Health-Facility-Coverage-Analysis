**Ghana Health Facility Coverage Analysis**

The dataset used for this project was provided as part of a Citizen Data Science initiative (sourced from Kaggle), designed to support learning and practical engagement with real-world public datasets. It offers a comprehensive listing of healthcare facilities in Ghana, organized by Region and District. Key attributes captured in the dataset include the type of health facility (e.g., CHPS compound, clinic, hospital), ownership category (e.g., public, private, NGO), and geolocation information.

Project Overview:
This project provides an analytical overview of the distribution and diversity of health facilities across Ghana. Using a dataset comprising 3,540 health facilities across 169 districts and 2,444 towns, the dashboard helps uncover spatial and structural patterns in healthcare access, facility types, and ownership models. The insights generated are intended to support health sector planning, policy decisions, and equitable infrastructure development through identifying underserved regions, understanding ownership structures, and exploring facility type composition.

Regional Distribution:
The Ashanti Region records the highest number of facilities (658), followed by Greater Accra (504) and Western Region (496). On the lower end, Upper West (161) and Upper East (232) show the fewest facilities, highlighting regional imbalances in infrastructure.

 Facility Type Composition:
The analysis revealed that CHPS compounds and clinics dominate the healthcare facility landscape, especially in rural regions like Northern and Upper East. Higher-level facilities such as hospitals are more concentrated in urban centers. This distinction helps illustrate the varying levels of care available across the country. The dashboard reveals that maternity homes are present across all regions but in varying proportions. They appear to have a notably stronger presence in regions like Brong Ahafo, Eastern, and Central, where they form a visible part of the facility type mix. In contrast, regions such as Volta, Upper West, and Northern show a relatively lower frequency of maternity homes. This uneven distribution may reflect regional differences in maternal health service delivery, reliance on alternative facility types, or targeted healthcare investments.

Facility Type Diversity by Region:
Analysis of distinct facility types per region reveals that Central and Brong Ahafo have the highest variety (up to 17 unique types), indicating broader healthcare service availability. Conversely, Western and Eastern regions show lower type diversity, possibly limiting access to specialized services.

Ownership:
The 10 ownership types that exist across the country reflects a multi-stakeholder healthcare system that includes government, private, NGO, and faith-based institutions.

Recommendations:
To improve healthcare coverage and equity in Ghana, it is recommended that infrastructure investments be prioritized in underserved regions such as Upper West, Upper East, and Northern, where health facility counts are significantly lower. Regions with limited diversity in facility types, such as Western and Eastern, should consider expanding their range of services to meet broader healthcare needs. In areas dominated by CHPS compounds, there is a need to strengthen access to secondary and tertiary care to ensure effective referral and emergency response. Collaborations with private, NGO, and faith-based organizations should be encouraged to enhance healthcare reach, particularly in remote and under-resourced communities. Future analysis would benefit from integrating population density and health outcome data to better align facility placement with demand. Additionally, incorporating geospatial accessibility modeling—such as travel time or road network data—can reveal hidden barriers to access. To support continuous planning and response efforts, maintaining and regularly updating health facility data is also strongly recommended.

Skills and Tools Used:
This project was developed using Power BI, leveraging its powerful data modeling, visualization, and dashboard design capabilities. Key skills applied in the course of this analysis include;
•	Data Cleaning and Transformation using Power Query
•	Data Modeling and creation of relationships between tables
•	Interactive Dashboard Design using slicers, filters, and visual formatting
•	Chart and Map Visualizations, including clustered column charts, stacked bar charts, card visuals, and filled maps
•	Analytical Reasoning to uncover insights from regional distributions, facility types, and ownership structures
•	Design for Accessibility and Clarity, ensuring the dashboard is intuitive and decision-maker friendly
